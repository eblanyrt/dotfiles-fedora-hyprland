# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires

# default is to keep current terminal color

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen
